<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we begin our study of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(abstract_data_type)">tree ADT</a>.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Tuesday, March 25th and Thursday, March 27th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class today by having groups share their solutions to the
<code>RGThing Priority Queues</code> project assigned
<a href="week07.html">last class</a>.
</p><p>
We will then introduce a new ADT, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree">binary tree</a>, which
we will be studying for the next several weeks. We'll begin with a look
at how we could implement the binary tree ADT in C++ using
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch20.html">Chapter 20:
Trees</a> from our textbook.
</p><p>
Now that we will be studying more abstract data structures and algorithms, our
purpose will be better served by using a higher level language. Last year I
switched to Python at this point, but this year I am hoping you will all agree
to go on a new adventure, and use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a>
this year.
</p><p>
The quickest way for us to dive into Ruby would be to use this
<a href="https://github.com/ThibaultJanBeyer/cheatsheets/blob/master/Ruby-Cheatsheet.md">
Ruby Cheatsheet</a> along with
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> curriculum to
get a crash course in Ruby, and then write something we have already written in
C++. That will minimize the cognitive load by using a new language on a
familiar programming problem.
</p><p>
Looking back over what we have done this year, one project stands out for
this purpose, the <code>Card</code> objects we looked at in chapters
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch12.html">12</a>,
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch13.html">13</a>,
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch14.html">14</a>, and
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch15.html">15</a> of our
text.
</p><p>
We will be pairing up for this project, and I want most of you to be able to
choose your partners (the exception being the students who will be paired with
students in Liberia).

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Use the two resources provided above to give yourself a crash course in Ruby.
The, working with your partner, begin to implement a <code>Card</code> class in
Ruby.
