<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The quiz grades for linked lists were excellent (<b>A</b>: 11, <b>B</b>: 2,
<b>C</b>: 1, <b>D</b>: 1), suggesting the group project approach to learn new
data types might be working for us, so this week we will use it again as we
study <a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch18.html">Chapter 18:
Stacks</a>.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We're going to take a few minutes to go over the quiz. Johan, Isaac, Marin,
Cody, Luis, Anar, Adonis and Jametheil, please sit near the white boards at the
beginning of class. I'm going to discuss the single node case that several of
you thought you had to handle specially, even though you didn't. Luis had a
delightful solution for this special case we should also see, even though he
didn't need it either. Anfal wrote a comment in his code that nicely points out
why the special case isn't special.
</p><p>
I didn't see anyone sketch out a diagram, which I think would have really
helped those of you who did struggle a bit with this. I'll say again that
<i>it is the abstraction that gives you the power to reason about this!</i>
</p><p>
Next we will divide into groups for our stack projects.
</p><p>
I ran the python random group generator, which gave us the following groups
for this next project:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Towers of Hanoi</b>: Adonis, Marin, Cody and Parker</li>
<li><b>has_matching_tags</b>: Turner, Ved, Issac and Caleb</li>
<li><b>eval_postfix_expr</b>: Anar, Anfal, Jamethiel and Johan</li>
<li><b>is_valid_infix_expr</b>: Luis, Trostin and Akshay</li>
</ul><p>
We will divide up the as yet incomplete
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch18.html#evaluating-postfix-expressions">Evaluating postfix expressions</a> and the three
projects in
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch18/ch18s01.html">
Chapter 18 Exercise Set 1: Stack Applications</a> among the four groups.
</p><p>
We'll then discuss what it means to <i>parse</i> a string, and talk about how
each group except the <i>Towers of Hanoi</i> group will have to write a parser.
</p><p>
Whatever time remains you can use to begin work on your projects.
