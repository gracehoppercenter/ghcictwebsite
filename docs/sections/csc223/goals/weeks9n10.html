<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will conclude our crash course in
<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> that we began last week, and
begin using it to study computer science.
</p></p>
I'll be out Friday, April 11th, so we will have this last assignment of the
quarter due on Wednesday, April 9th.
</p>

<h2>Friday, April 11th</h2>

<h3>Next Project and Project Pairs</h3>
<div>
<p>
I'm out today, and I know several of you told me you would be out too. So think
of this as your early introduction to what we will be working on during our
first class after we return from Spring break on Wednesday, April 23rd.
</p><p>
Our task will be to implement a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">binary search
tree</a> in Ruby. You will work in the following pairs to complete this
project:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Anar and Adonis</li>
<li>Akshay and Cody</li>
<li>Luis and Mulbah</li>
<li>Ved and Turner</li>
<li>Jamethiel and Caleb</li>
<li>Isaac and Marin</i>
<li>Anfal and Trostin</i>
<li>Parker and Johan</i>
</ul>
<p>
These pairs were not random, but were instead intentionally choosen by me as
<q>clique breakers</q> with an eye toward combating Senioritis. We'll see how
well I did ;-)
</p>
</div>

<h3>BSTs with Paper and Pencil</h3>
<div>
<p>
We want to create a ``BinarySearchTree`` class with the following methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>insert(value)</code>: Inserts a value into the BST</li>
<li><code>search(value)</code>: Returns true if value exists in the tree</li>
<li><code>delete(value)</code>: Removes a value from the tree</li>
<li><code>in_order_traversal</code>: Returns array of values in sorted order
</li>
<li><code>pre_order_traversal</code>: Returns array in root-left-right order
</li>
<li><code>post_order_traversal</code>: Returns array in left-right-root order
</li>
<li><code>min</code>: Returns the minimum value</li>
<li><code>max</code>: Returns the maximum value</li>
<li><code>height</code>: Returns the height of the tree</li>
<li>empty?</code>: Returns true if tree has no nodes</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before you can implement these in code, you should practice doing them <i>on
paper by hand</i>. Use your class time today to do just that.
</p>

<h2>Monday, April 7th and Wednesday, April 9th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin class today by having students share where they are in their
Ruby study. Except for the three students who have already presented
(Akshay, Trostin and Caleb), the rest of you will be selected one by one
at random to share your work. We'll do this as long as both time and our
attention spans permit.
</p><p>
Then we will start using Ruby in our study of data structures and algorithms.
When we left off in C++ we were beginning to study
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree">binary trees</a>. We will
resume that study now, using
<a href="https://www.mikeperham.com/2014/11/26/building-a-binary-tree-with-enumerable/">Building
a Binary Tree with Enumerable</a> to get us started, and implementing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">binary search
tree</a> as our first project.
</p>

<h2>Tuesday, April 1st and and Thursday, April 3rd</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will continue to work in the learning groups below for the remainder of
this quarter. I recommend using
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby">The
Odin Project Ruby Course</a> as your main resource. If you encounter any
problems with the old ruby version on your school laptops, I found several
online interpreters you can use.
<p></p>
At the beginning of class on Tuesday we will discuss how this assignment will
be evaluated.
</p>

<h3>Learning Groups</h3>
<ul>
<li>Turner and Parker</li>
<li>Akshay, Marin, Trostin and Anar</li>
<li>Anfal, Adonis, Isaac and Jeff</li>
<li>Jametheil, Cody and Caleb</li>
<li>Luis and Mulbah</li>
<li>Ved and Thomas</li>
