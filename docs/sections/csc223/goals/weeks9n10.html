<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will conclude our crash course in
<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> that we began last week, and
begin using it to study computer science.
</p></p>
I'll be out Friday, April 11th, so we will have this last assignment of the
quarter due on Wednesday, April 9th.

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
This week we will start using Ruby in our study of data structures and
algorithms. When we left off in C++ we were beginning to study
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree">binary trees</a>. We will
resume that study now, using
<a href="https://www.mikeperham.com/2014/11/26/building-a-binary-tree-with-enumerable/">Building
a Binary Tree with Enumerable</a> to get us started, and implementing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">binary search
tree</a> as our first project.

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>

<p>
We will continue to work in the learning groups below for the remainder of
this quarter. I recommend using
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby">The
Odin Project Ruby Course</a> as your main resource. If you encounter any
problems with the old ruby version on your school laptops, I found several
online interpreters you can use.
<p></p>
At the beginning of class on Tuesday we will discuss how this assignment will
be evaluated.
