<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will finish our study of <b>queues</b> and <b>priority queues</b>.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Friday, March 21st</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll get back our quizzes on priority queues and go over them.
</p><p>
You will have the rest of class time and homework time to work in your quueue
groups on the following project.
</p>
</div>

<h3>RGThing Priority Queues</h3>
<p>
Given the following:
</p><pre>
enum Color {RED, GREEN};

struct RGThing {
    Color color; 
    string label;
};

struct RGTpair {
    RGThing thing1;
    RGThing thing2;
};
</pre><p>
Create a <code>RGTPQ</code> class implements a priority queue of
<code>RGThings</code> with the following member functions:
</p><ul>
<li><code>bool empty();</code></li>
<li><code>void insert(RGThing);</code></li>
<li><code>RGTpair remove();</code></li>
</ul><p>
<code>RGThing</code>s can be inserted (using the <code>insert(RGThing)</code>
member function) as they arrive, and they are removed from the
<code>RGTPQ</code> using a FIFO discipline, except for the following additional
requirement: the <code>remove()</code> member function returns an
<code>RGTpair</code> with one <code>RED</code> and one <code>GREEN</code>
<code>RGThing</code>.
</p><p>
This means that <code>RGTPQ</code> has to implement a <i>hybrid</i> discipline,
since if it is filled with only <code>RED</code> <code>RGThing</code>s, no
pair can be removed.  The first <code>GREEN</code> <code>RGThing</code> that
enters the queue will thus have to be given a priority discipline that moves
it to the front of the queue.
</p><p>
Come to class Tuesday ready to be present your solutions. 
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Monday, March 17th and Wednesday, March 19th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
As we discussed last week, we will let Python
(<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; randint(1, 4)</code>) decide among the groups:
</p><ol>
<li>Turner, Caleb, Cody and Parker</li>
<li>Marin, Luis, Anfal and Ved</li>
<li>Anar, Johan, Issac and Jamethiel</li>
<li>Trostin, Akshay and Adonis</li>
</ol><p>
The selected group will share their
<a href="week06.html">deliverables from last week</a> with the rest of us. The
other groups will be individually evaluated based on their git repos, using the
usual standards for evaluation.
</p><p>
After the presentation, you will have the rest of class and homework time
Monday and Wednesday to read the now more or less completed
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch19.html">Chapter 19: Queues
and priority queues</a>, and to complete all the activities in each of the
three exercise sets linked at the end of the chapter.
</p><p>
Come to class Wednesday prepared for a short quiz on Monday's presentation.
</p><p>
Come to class Friday ready to be randomly chosen to present your work from
the exercises.
