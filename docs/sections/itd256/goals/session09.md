## What We'll Do In Class

### Presentations

Today, we were joined by Ripley Moyers, librarian from Columbia Pike Library. 
Each group presented their projects, and we had a nice conversation with Ripley
about their work and experiences with Library Sciences.

I'm really happy with how this project turned out - thanks to everyone for
the work that you put into it =)

## Homework - Preview Next Unit

For the next few classes, we'll follow a famous online textbook called
[Use the Index, Luke](https://use-the-index-luke.com/).

For homework, please read through the preface, and the first chapter, 
[Anatomy of an Index](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/anatomy).
As you read, take Markdown notes and add them to your Github. There are a lot 
of details to understand and some complex data structures introduced. Don't 
worry too much about the details, we're just looking for a general understanding
of what an index is.
