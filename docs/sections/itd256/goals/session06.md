## What We'll Do In Class

### Github Cleanup

I tried to grade the notes from the recent reading assignment and couldn't find
anybody's notes! Please take a look at the link I have for you on [Our students page](https://ict.gctaa.net/sections/itd256/students.html) and make sure that I can get to all of your work from that link. Let me know if you'd like me to change which link I have!

### Card Simulation

We'll go back and finish the playing card simulation from a [few classes ago](session.html?num=01)


### Project work

We'll use the remaining time for project work. See the [formal project description, here](../projects/)
