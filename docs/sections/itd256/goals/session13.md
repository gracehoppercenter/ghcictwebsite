## What We'll Do In Class

### Review Cardinality Readings

When we were together on Friday, I didn't do a great job of talking through the page about 'slow indexes'. The lesson from that page is important, so I want to revisit it. We'll also weave in the readings that you did on Tuesday about 
'How PosgreSQL counts without counting'. I wrote some Python code to help visualize what's going on with all of this, so I'll demonstrate that.

## ORM issues

The readings have made a few comments about issues with ORMs. Let's quickly
discuss what an ORM is. We'll revisit this next week.

## Joins

For homework, I asked you to read about join operators. We'll discuss why
algorithmic complexity for join operators is a big deal, and then we'll go back to our decks of cards for an exercise to help us understand the importance of each of these operators.

## Homework

### More Reading
No homework today. Enjoy your long weekend!

Next week, we'll return to Python to play with ORMs
