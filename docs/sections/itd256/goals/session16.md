## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:


## What We'll Do In Class


### Finish Django Model Activity
Last class, we started creating Django models based on the database designs we made last semester. We'll start today by wrapping up that activity.

### Fake Data
If we have time, we'll work on generating some fake data to add to our models.

For our previous design, we used Mockaroo. Now that we're purely in Python, we'll use a similar tool called [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/). (you'll need to `pip install faker` to use it).


## Homework
No homework! We'll keep working in class on Friday
