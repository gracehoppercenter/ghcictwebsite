## What We'll Do In Class


### Finish Django Faker Activity

At the end of last class, a lot of folks were still working on
generating sample data with Faker. We'll continue to work on this in class.

### Introduce pgAdmin

Now that we have our shiny new PostgreSQL server, I was able to install [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), 
a really nice open-source SQL IDE. It's web-based, and you can get to it at:
<http://mintcream.local:8123>. Once we have our sample data created,
we'll play with pgAdmin to take a look at our tables and explain some queries.

Here's a nice tutorial you can follow: <https://www.w3schools.com/postgresql/postgresql_pgadmin4.php>.

## Homework
No homework! We'll keep working in class on Friday
