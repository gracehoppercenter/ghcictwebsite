## What We'll Do In Class

### Unit Test
Today is the Unit 1/2 test. As always, it's timed for 45 minutes
and you may use one hand-written cheat sheet.

Good luck!

### Unit 3 Preview
Our next unit will be about responsive design and accessibility.

To start, we want to update our websites to make sure that they work nice on 
mobile phone screens.

Try opening your website on your phone (or, you can open it  on your computer and
adjust the window to about your phone size) - how does it look? It probably looks
the same as it always does, just smaller and harder to read.

We'll take advantage of `media queries` in CSS to write specific CSS rules for
phone screens. Get started on tonight's reading assignments to learn more =)

### A look ahead
Unit 3 will be short, and will be pretty much our last content before the
certification test. I'm aiming to complete that certification by the end of the 
quarter. Unit 4 will focus on preparing for certification!

## Homework

### Reading - media queries

Your reading assignment today is a little long. Be sure to go through it all
slowly and be prepared for a reading quiz next class!

The Edube page about media queries is in the CSS course. As usual, you'll need 
to be logged in to edube before you click on this link:

- [Media Queries](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-css/media-queries?action=page#intro-to-media-queries)

Note that this page is in the middle of a unit and uses some float rules that you
might not be familiar with. You should also read the previous two pages 
to get the context (these are also fair game for the reading quiz):

- [Floats](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-css/basics-of-floats-1?action=page#the-float-property-and-its-values)
- [Multi column layouts using CSS Floats](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-css/creating-multi-column-layouts-using-css-floats-1?action=page#applying-floats-to-the-columns)

To apply media queries to grids, I like this page:
