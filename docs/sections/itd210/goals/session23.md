## What We'll Do In Class

### WDE Exam Debrief
Don't forget to schedule your retake!

See the note at the top of [last class](session.html?num=20) for the instructions.

### Grades

Your grades are finalized for Q3. Let me know if you have questions about them!

### Reading Quiz: Javascript Functions

### Activity: Javascript Functions Can Call Other Functions

In class, we'll do another short example in Canvas where we'll write a function
that calls another function. Then you'll work on your own example. For this
asssignment, follow these steps:
- Come up with a complex shape that is made up of a few smaller shapes (just like
how our snowman is made up of a few smaller circles)
- Create at least one "helper function" that draws the smaller shapes (
    in our example, that's `circle()`
)
- Create a second function that calls that helper (in our example, that's 
`snowman()`)
- Call that function a few times to "stamp" your shape
- Add a nice background to complete your scene
- Commit your work and add a link on your website. This will count as a 4th
quarter grade!

## No homework - Enjoy your break =)
