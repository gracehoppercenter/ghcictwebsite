## Exam Prep!

### Exam Information
The exam is timed for 40 minutes, and has 40 multiple choice questions. You'll take it on your computer, and cheat sheets are not allowed.

See [the exam website](https://js.institute/wde-certification) for more information.

This exam will count as a test grade in my class. To calculate your grade for my class, I will add 15% to your score. 75% is a passing score on the exam, and will count as 90% (an A) for my class.

### Exam Prep
Last class, I asked you to start an exam review journal. You went through each topic covered on the exam and gave yourself a score that represents how confident you feel about that topic.

Today, you'll work on your own to review some of the topics that you feel least confident about.

Pick at least **two** topics that you gave relatively low scores (see [the exam syllabus](https://js.institute/wde-exam-syllabus) for information about distribution). For each topic you selected:
- review the materials in Edube (and you might want to do a Google search to find other helpful materials)
- Write a simple HTML/CSS page to practice/demonstrate the topic
- Add a short summary to the journal entry you started last class. Your journal entry should explain the topic that you chose, link to the practice page you made, summarize how the practice makes you feel more comfortable with the topic, and give yourself a new confidence score.


### Signups

While you're working, I'll come around and collect email addresses so that I can assign test tickets.

## Homework

### Keep preparing!
We'll take a practice test in class next time. It will be similar to the pre-test that you took at the beginning of the year, and it'll count for a completion grade.
