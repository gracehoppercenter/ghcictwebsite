## What We'll Do In Class

### Accessibility
I'll be out on Friday, so I won't be able to lead an accessibility discussion like I would like, but this topic is important!

Making sure our websites are accessible is the right thing to do, it's good for business, and it's the law.

Most website accessibility issues relate to vision. The CDC estimates that about [1 in 21 adults in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/disability-and-health/articles-documents/disabilities-health-care-access.html) lives with some sort of vision disability. If you were operating a business, would you want
to exclude 1 in 21 adults from being potential customers?

This is also a huge issue for small businesses that build their own websites - failing to make a website meet the required accessibility
standards can lead to lawsuits and fines. [A recent report](https://info.usablenet.com/2023-midyear-digital-accessibility-lawsuit-report-pdf-download-plain-text?utm_campaign=June%20Webinar&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=264311291&utm_content=264311291&utm_source=hs_email) said that more than 4000 businesses in the US each year receive lawsuits about the accessibility of their websites, and 77% of those are against businesses with less than $25M in revenue.

### Check your website for accessibility

It's easy to do! Try putting your website in the [Accessibility Checker](https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/audit/?website=cjonesexample.github.io&flag=us#). Be sure to fix any issues that it suggests.

To see what a failing report looks like, [here's what it says about my `cjonesexample` website](https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/audit/?website=cjonesexample.github.io&flag=us#). My actual personal website [does pass the checker](https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/audit/?website=chrismjon.es&flag=us)


### Setup an exam study journal

Our certification test is right around the corner! We'll use our Markdown journals to create and follow a study plan.

For today, copy/paste this template into your own journal, and then follow the instructions to fill in the `confidence` column.

You should start reviewing any topics that you gave a low score to, and we'll start systematically working through this next class.


## Homework

No reading assignment today. Our focus now is on preparing for the certification test!
