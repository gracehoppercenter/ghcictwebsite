## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:

- **Be Able To** use image maps to add an interactive element to your website.

## What We'll Do In Class

### Quiz
No reading quiz today!

### Activity - Image Map
As you read, image maps are a fun way to add interactivity to your website. My favorite use of them is for easter eggs. I've added one to my class website here: [https://cjonesexample.github.io/](https://cjonesexample.github.io/) - try clicking on the cat's nose.

Today, you'll add your own fun easter egg to your own website. Choose any picture on your homepage and add an image map with a link that directs somewhere fun.

This assignment is due at the end of the day on Wednesday

#### Tips

- The coordinates for the image map are expressed in `x,y` pairs, from the top-left of the image. The coordinates don't show up well in the Firefox inspector, so it might take some guess-and-check'ing to get them right.

- image maps do not work well with dynamic images. You'll need to use a static-sized image for this activity. If your image  is too big, you can use [Preview to resize it](https://support.apple.com/guide/preview/crop-resize-or-rotate-an-image-prvw2015/mac) or use an online tool.
