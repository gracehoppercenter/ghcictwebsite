## What We'll Do In Class


### iFrames
We'll quickly discuss iFrames. I recommend that you practice by adding an iFrame to your website, but I won't make this a graded classwork assignment.

### Test Review
We'll do a short test review activity

### Test Prep
Prep for the test! As always, you may bring a cheat sheet to the test - one page of letter-sized paper, hand written, front and back.

Here is a list of topics that will be covered on this test:
- Forms:
    - Input types
    - Form labels
    - GET vs POST
    - Browser validation for input types
    - `fieldset`
- Branches and Pull Requests in Git
- Image CSS
    - Aspect Ratio
    - `width` and `height`
    - `max-width`, `min-width`, `max-height`, `min-height`
    - `align`, `object-fit`, `object-position`
    - `border` and `border-radius`
    - `box-shadow`
        - I won't expect you to know the syntax for this one
    - `opacity`
    - `filter`
        - I won't expect you to know the specific list of filters that can be applied
    - `z-index` 
- Connecting Images to `<figcaption>` tags and `<map>`
    - I won't expect that you know the exact syntax for maps, just that you understand the idea, and that you understand the coordinate system it uses
- Video codecs (Not the specific names, just the concept)
    Lossy vs Lossless
- Creating art with Canvas vs CSS vs SVG
    - Canvas (from the self portrait activity):
        - I won't expect you to be able to write any of the specific JavaScript functions, or any of the circle geometry we discussed, but I might provide some code and ask you to tell me where the shapes will be.
        - The difference between `width` and `height` in the HTML attributes vs in CSS
    - CSS (from the emoji activity):
    - SVG:
        - we didn't do any specific activity here, so there won't be detailed questions. I just want you to know what it is.
- CSS Transitions and Animation:
    - When to use transitions vs animation
    - Syntax
    - `@keyframes`
    - the `:hover` pseudo-class


## Homework

### Study!
Come prepared for our test next class.

I think the trickiest part of this test is the image CSS. Definitely re-read those pages and review your image gallery assignment - make sure you understand what each of those attributes does!
