## What We'll Do In Class

### Github Profile
Hi! I'll be out today (Friday), so here's the activity I'd like you to work on while I'm out: customizing your Github profile.

As I've discussed lots of times in class, your Github account is a fantastic portfolio that you can use to connect with other programmers and demonstrate your experience to employers.

So far this year, we've focused on using Pages to create a custom HTML page. Today, we'll add some customization to your profile on Github. As an example, take a look at my profile here: [https://github.com/MrJonesAPS](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS)

The best first step is to add a profile readme. To do that, follow the instructions here: [Profile Readme](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)

You should also:
- Update your avatar to something other than the default
- Add a bio, [following these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/using-your-github-profile-to-enhance-your-resume#step-1-create-a-professional-bio)

As always, the information that you're writing here is available on the public internet. I expect that everything you post here is professional, and I have no requirement that you share any personal information. Please let me know if you have any concerns with this assignment, or with our use of Github!

I'll count this as a classwork grade, due at the end of the day on Friday, March 7th.
