## What We'll Do In Class

### WDE Exam Debrief
Don't forget to schedule your retake! I'm expecting that 17 people will plan
retakes, and so far I've only heard from 1!

See the note at the top of [last class](session.html?num=20) for the instructions.

### Grades

Your grades are finalized for Q3. Let me know if you have questions about them!

### Reading Quiz: Javascript Module 1

### Activity: Javascript Functions
We learned two functions last time, `alert()` and `log()`. Today we'll
work on creating our own functions. We'll write a few simple functions together.

### Classwork: Javascript Functions for Canvas
My plan for the next several classes is that we'll use the HTML canvas to 
practice the techniques we're learning in Javascript.

For today's activity, start with the same starter code that I gave you 
for the self portrait activity in [session 11](session.html?num=11). Modify that
code as follows:
- Create a function that draws a circle on the canvas. You can choose the color
and radius of the circle, but the `x,y` coordinates for the circle's center
should be inputs to the function.
- Call that function 5 times to draw 5 different circles on the screen.

## Homework - if needed
Our quiz format is going to change for the next few classes. Instead of a reading
quiz, I'll ask you to review the concepts that we've practice, and I'll give you
a short coding quiz.

So for this quiz, practice with functions. 
We'll have a short quiz on functions next class.

Here's an example question that might be on that quiz (this one is tricky - 
pay attention to the spaces!!)

```
What would this javascript code print to the console?

function a(x){
    console.log("hello" + x);
}

a("chris")
a("bob")
```
