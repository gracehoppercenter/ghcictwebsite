## What We'll Do In Class

### Reading Quiz
We'll start with a reading quiz about CSS Transitions

### Transitions

Transitions are a really nice way to help users understand how to interact with
your website. On [my personal website](https://chrismjon.es/portfolio/), I use
transitions two ways:
- In the nav bar, the colors change when you hover over them
- In the blog post gallery below, the images grow when you hover over them

I also added a transition to [my canvas self portrait here](https://cjonesexample.github.io/)

Your assignment is to add a thoughtful, helpful transition somewhere on your homepage.
No need to write or submit anything from this assignment - I'll see it on
your homepage! This assignment is due next Wednesday (the 12th).
