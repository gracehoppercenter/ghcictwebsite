## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:

- **Understand** how CSS can be used to create detailed shapes and movements
- **Be able to** create your own animated image using CSS

## What We'll Do In Class

### Reading Quiz
We'll start with a reading quiz about CSS animation

### CSS Shapes and Animation

We now have the power to make some pretty cool content using only CSS.
We'll quickly compare how we create drawings with  CSS  vs with Canvas.

Then we'll work through this animation tutorial: [https://codehs.com/tutorial/mattarnold/css-art](https://codehs.com/tutorial/mattarnold/css-art). You'll probably want to reference this page as you're working on it: [CSS Art Code Snippets](https://css-art-snippets-1-6200438.codehs.me/index.html)

There are a few things about their sample code that i don't love (it isn't even valid HTML!), so I've created my own version here:
- [emoji.html](https://github.com/CJonesExample/CJonesExample.github.io/blob/main/emoji.html)
- [emoji.css](https://github.com/CJonesExample/CJonesExample.github.io/blob/main/emoji.css)

### Emoji Classwork
Your assignment is to make this tutorial your own. The tutorial makes the face laugh, so you should make it do anything else... smile, wink, nod, etc. You should also come up with your own shape for the eyes. If you want a challenge, you could make an entirely different emoji!

As always, commit this to your repo and link it to your website. This assignment is due at the end of the day Friday.
