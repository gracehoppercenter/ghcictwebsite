## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:
- **Understand** how HTML and Javascript work together to create HTML Canvas Graphics
- **Be able to** create your own intentional image using HTML Canvas

## What We'll Do In Class

### Reading Quiz
We'll start with a reading quiz about HTML entities and graphics

### HTML Canvas - Self Portrait
This class, we'll play with HTML Canvas, a fun and easy way to make custom art
to display on your website. This will be our first serious look at Javascript, so we'll 
start with a quick overview of the syntax and structure, and then we'll look at 
some canvas examples. 

To get you started, [we'll review my example here](https://cjonesexample.github.io/canvas_example.html)

To practice, you'll work on making a self-portrait using HTML Canvas. This assignment
is inspired by [https://www.code-art.com/codeyourself/](https://www.code-art.com/codeyourself/), an
annual online self-portrait competition (we missed the submission deadline this year, but you
might want to hang onto your code and submit it next year!).

I don't have any specific requirements for this assignment, just play with Canvas
until you feel comfortable.

In addition to the samples included in my code, you might consider:
- [Adding gradients](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_gradients.asp)
- [Adding text](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_text.asp)

### Github Profile
Hi! I'll be out today (Friday), so here's the activity I'd like you to work on while I'm out: customizing your Github profile.

As I've discussed lots of times in class, your Github account is a fantastic portfolio that you can use to connect with other programmers and demonstrate your experience to employers.

So far this year, we've focused on using Pages to create a custom HTML page. Today, we'll add some customization to your profile on Github. As an example, take a look at my profile here: [https://github.com/MrJonesAPS](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS)

The best first step is to add a profile readme. To do that, follow the instructions here: [Profile Readme](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)

You should also:
- Update your avatar to something other than the default
- Add a bio, [following these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/using-your-github-profile-to-enhance-your-resume#step-1-create-a-professional-bio)

As always, the information that you're writing here is available on the public internet. I expect that everything you post here is professional, and I have no requirement that you share any personal information. Please let me know if you have any concerns with this assignment, or with our use of Github!

I'll count this as a classwork grade, due at the end of the day on Friday, March 7th. 

## Homework

### Finish your ongoing assignments
- The project is due at the end of the day Tuesday (A day - that's today)!
- Your video assignment was due last week, but I won't get around to grading it until after the project. Finish it soon if you haven't already!
- Your Github profile assignment is due at the end of the day this Friday

### Reading

Here's your next reading assignment. Be prepared for a reading quiz next class!

- [Transitions and Interactivity](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-css/transitions-and-interactivity-1)
- [Transitions and Their Practical Examples â€“ Part 1](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-css/transitions-and-their-practical-examples-part-1-1)

You're welcome to look at Part 2, but it's pretty involved. I won't include anything about Part 2 on the reading quiz.
