## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:

- **Understand** the difference between lossy and lossless compression.
- **Be Able To** embed audio and video into your website.

## What We'll Do In Class

### Quiz
As promised, we'll start with a reading quiz about media.

### Codecs and Compression

We'll have a short discussion about **codecs**, and why there are many different
types of compression. We'll categorize compression into two types:
- Lossless (we'll play with [this simulator](https://studio.code.org/s/text-compression/lessons/1/levels/2) to understand how lossless compression works)
- Lossy

### Activity - Video

We'll practice by adding a video to our websites.

You can search for videos here: [Pixabay Videos](https://pixabay.com/videos/). That
website will likely download a `mp4` video. To convert to `webm`, you can use
an online converter, [like this one](https://video.online-convert.com/convert-to-webm)

And see my example here: [My video](https://cjonesexample.github.io/video)

We will discuss how uploading videos to github is not really best practice, but
it's the best way to get this assignment to work.


## Homework

### Keep working on your project!

Remember - it's due next Tuesday

### Reading

I will be out on Friday, so you'll have an activity about customizing your 
github profile. Here's your next reading assignment, which we'll work with
after I return the following class:

- [HTML Entities](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-html/html-entities-and-emojis-1?action=page#html-entities)
- [HTML Graphics](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-html/html-graphics?action=page#canvas)
