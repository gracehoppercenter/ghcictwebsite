## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:
- **Understand** The importance of responsive web pages
- **Be able to** use media queries to customize CSS grid for different screen sizes
- **Be able to** use named regions in CSS grid to create responsive layouts


## What We'll Do In Class

### Test grades are in!
I can't give back the tests yet, but your grades are posted in StudentVue!

### No Quiz
I did not write a reading quiz today. You're still responsible for our reading about
media queries and responsive layouts, and we'll practice with that today.


### Opening Discussion

How big is a pixel? If you create something that is `300px` wide, will it be the same width
on every screen?

### Responsive Layouts

I'll show off Firefox's "Responsive Design Mode." We'll use this to test out our websites and make sure
they will look nice on all devices.

### Media Queries and named grid areas

I really like the way they setup and used named grid areas, and then reconfigured them with media queries in the "thoughtbot" reading.

Your assignment today is to replicate that setup.

Be sure to test it out using Responsive Design Mode, and to use
the `viewport` tag to setup the pixels.


### Looking Ahead: Start preparing for the WDE Exam

I'm aiming for April 3/4 for our certification test (that's about 2  weeks away). I'll talk more about this in class,
and you should start reviewing the material on your own. Here's the
list of topics:

## Homework

Our next topic is about accessibility (sometimes written as [a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/)). We'll start with these two pages
in the HTML course:

- [What is Web Accessibility](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-html/accessibility-part-1-1)
- [Accessible Rich Internet Applications](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-html/accessibility-part-2-1)
