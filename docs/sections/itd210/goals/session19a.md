## What We'll Do In Class

### Loose Ends

We'll start with a quick chat about a few exam topics we haven't yet addressed. I expect that the test questions about these topics will be easy, you'll just be expected to know what they are. We'll quickly review together these three pages:

- [Geolocation API - W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_geolocation)
- [ARIA - Edube](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-html/accessibility-part-2-1?action=page#aria)
- [Microdata - Edube](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-html/semantic-markup-part-2?action=page#intro-to-microformats-microdata-schema-org)
- [UTF-8 - Edube](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-html/character-encoding-1?action=page#how-to-specify-the-encoding-standard)

### Help me write a practice test

Next class, we'll do a practice test. Today, I'd like your help writing it!

With a partner, you'll take a set of WDE exam objectives and write some possible multiple-choice questions about them. We'll count-off topics in class, using the id's that I've added to [Our exam prep journal](https://github.com/CJonesExample/CJonesExample.github.io/blob/main/journal/entries/exam_prep.md).

For each topic, I'd like you to write three questions, with these topics:

- One question about how or why you would use it
- One question about syntax
- One question that does not name the topic, provides some sample code, and asks what effect the code would have

Write your questions in a google doc and share with me. Any format is okay - I write all my tests in LaTeX, so I'll select some questions to use in our practice test and convert them.

## Homework

Nothing to turn in, but continue preparing for the test!
