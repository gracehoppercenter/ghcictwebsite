## What We'll Do In Class

### WDE Exam Debrief

Congrats to everyone who passed the test - I'm really proud of you all, and you should be proud too!

For those who did not pass, I have a new plan for retakes. I really want you to pass on your second attempt and don't want to rush you.  So here is my new plan:

- I already put your current exam score in the gradebook as a Q3 grade.
- If you retake the exam before the end of April and get a better score, I'll update your grade in the gradebook
    - If that changes your Q3 grade, I can't promise that I'll be able to get your Q3 grade officially changed, but I'll try
    - Regardless, I'll include the new score when I calculate your final grade for the year and for NOVA ITD 210

Because of this new scheme, I'm not going to schedule a whole-class retake next week. I'd rather that you each take the time that you need to review, and schedule your retake individually.

To schedule your retake, email Jeff Elkner (<jde232@email.vccs.edu>) and cc me (<cmj2310@email.vccs.edu>) and suggest some times that work for you. Here are the times that usually work well for Jeff:
- Any day before school. Jeff usually gets here at about 6am
- Any day during 3rd or 5th period (for non-ACC folks, that's 10-1130, 130-3)

If you go to another school and have trouble getting here outside of our regular class time, talk to me. We might be able to find someone at your home school who can proctor for us.

### Grades

I think your grades are finalized for Q3. Let me know if you have questions about them!

### Looking Ahead

Now that we're certified experts in HTML and CSS, we'll move on to the third part of the trifecta - JavaScript =). There's a new Edube course for this: <https://edube.org/study/jse1>. 

Today, I'd like you to register for this new Edube course and start going through Module 1 - you should pretty much already know most of this, and we'll chat about the highlights in class.

## Homework - if needed

Finish going through Module 1 - we'll have a reading quiz next class. This quiz will be our first grade for Q4.
