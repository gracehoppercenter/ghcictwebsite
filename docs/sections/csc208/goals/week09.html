<h2>Friday, April 4th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class with the promised long quiz on <i>Section 2.6: Relations
and Graphs</i>, and then move on to <i>Chapter 3: Counting</i>, beginning
today with
<a href="https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi4/sec_counting-pascal.html">
Section 3.1: Pascal's Arithmetical Triangle</a>.
</p><p>
Today after the quiz you should read the section and take good notes on the
definitions and theorem introduced. Complete <i>Reading Questions</i> 1, 2,
and 3.
</p><p>
We will have a short quiz at the beginning of class on this reading. Since it
is really important to learn these definitions and understand the theorem,
<i>you will not be able to use notes on this quiz!</i>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Today in class we will discuss <i>Section 2.6: Relations and Graphs</i> and
you will be given time to complete all the exercises. This is a much biggner
section than I realized when I first assigned it last week, and we will want
to spend an extra day on it.
</p><p>
You will have a test on this section at the beginning of class on Friday. Be
sure you become familiar with the vocabulary, concepts, and theorems presented
in this section. Your intrepid virtual classmate, Jos√© Ejemplo, has kindly
shared his notes from this section
<a href="https://codeberg.org/GraceHopperCenter/csc208/src/branch/main/ch2_graphs/sect2.6notes.md">
here</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete all <i>Practice Problems</i> and <i>Additional Exercises</i> from
<i>Section 2.6: Relations and Graphs</i>.  Prepare an 8 1/2 by 11 inch sheet
of paper with notes that you can use on the short test we will have on
Friday.
