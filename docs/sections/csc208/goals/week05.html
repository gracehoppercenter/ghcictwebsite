<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin class by reviewing the results of Wednesday's test. The grade
distribution was: <b>A</b>: 
</p><p>
We should pay special attention to:
</p><ol>
<li>
<pre>
$ ttg_cli.py "['P', 'Q', 'R']" -p "['~(~P => (Q and R))', '~P and (~Q or ~R)']" -i False

+-------+-------+-------+----------------------+---------------------+
|   P   |   Q   |   R   |  ~(~P => (Q and R))  |  ~P and (~Q or ~R)  |
|-------+-------+-------+----------------------+---------------------|
| True  | True  | True  |        False         |        False        |
| True  | True  | False |        False         |        False        |
| True  | False | True  |        False         |        False        |
| True  | False | False |        False         |        False        |

Gabriel C.'s proof for problem 2 using a set theory instead of
alegraic argument.</li>
</ol><p>
We will begin class with a discussion of the three <i>Reading Questions</i>
at the end of the section.
</p>

<h4>Is there more than one graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges?</h4>
<p>
When working with graphs, we need to understand what it means to
<q>be a graph</q>. The definition of <b>graph</b> is:
</p><blockquote>
An ordered pair G = (V, E) consisting of a nonempty set V (called the vertices) and a set E (called the edges) of two-element subsets of V.
</blockquote><p>
Graphs are <b>equal</b> when V and E are equal, but when we talk about
<q>more than one graph</q> we are interested in the concept of
<b>isomorphism</b>:
</p><blockquote>
An isomorphism between two graphs G1 and G2 is a bijection f: V1 -> V2 between
the vertices of the graphs such that {a, b} is an edge in G1 if and only if
{f(a), f(b)}  is an edge in G2.
</blockquote><p>
What we are really asking here is: <q>Is there more than one <b>isomorphism
class</b> with 5 vertices and 6 edges?</q>
</p>

<h4>A graph with 10 vertices of degree 4 has how many edges?</h4>

<h2>Wednesday, March 5th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will have a test today on <i>Chapter 1: Logic and Proofs</i>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read section <i>2.1: Graph Theory: Problems and Definitions</i>. Spend some
time thinking about the famous
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">Seven
Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg</a> problem presented at the beginning of the chapter.

<h2>Monday, March 3rd</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin class by discussing any questions you have from the exercises
assigned last Thursday. You'll have the rest of class and homework time
to continue working exercises from the lists below.
</p><p>
Prepare a single sheet of 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper, front and back, with notes
you can use on Wednesday's test. I recommend you include the definitions
and propositions presented in the chapter. 
</p>
</div>

<h3>Blu's List</h3>
<div>
<p>
Here is the promised <i>Blu's list</i> for the test on Wednesday:
</p>
<h4>Section 1.5: Proofs about Discrete Structues</h4> 
<ul>
<li><b>Practice Problems</b>: 1 through 5</li>
<li><b>Additional Exercises</b>: 1 through 12</li>
</ul>
<h4>Section 1.6: Chapter Summary</h4> 
<ul>
<li><b>Chapter Review</b>: 1 through 7, 8a, 9 and 10</li>
</ul><p>
Be sure you are comfortable generating truth tables, and can do the kinds of
proofs presented in the examples and exercises, which means being able to use
the <i>definitions</i> and <i>propositions</i> effectively. Having these handy
on your 8 1/2 by 11 inch resource sheet will be most useful to you.
