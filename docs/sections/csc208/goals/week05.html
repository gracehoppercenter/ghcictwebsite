<h3>Test Review</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin class by reviewing the results of Wednesday's test. The grade
distribution was: <b>A</b>: 9, <b>B</b>: 8, <b>C</b>: 4, <b>D</b>: 5, and
<b>E</b>: 5. That is an improvement over last time, but I'll share a few ideas
I have about how we can improve on it still further going forward.
</p><p>
Our good friend José Ejemplo has kindly shared
<a href="https://codeberg.org/GraceHopperCenter/csc208/src/branch/main/ch1_logic/resources/ProofsTestSolutions.pdf">
his solutions</a>, which we can use as a guide in our discussion.
</p><p>
Things from the test that we should pay special attention to:
</p><ol>
<li>
<pre>
$ ttg_cli.py "['P', 'Q', 'R']" -p "['~(~P =&gt; (Q and R))', '~P and (~Q or ~R)']" -i False

+-------+-------+-------+----------------------+---------------------+
|   P   |   Q   |   R   |  ~(~P =&gt; (Q and R))  |  ~P and (~Q or ~R)  |
|-------+-------+-------+----------------------+---------------------|
| True  | True  | True  |        False         |        False        |
| True  | True  | False |        False         |        False        |
| True  | False | True  |        False         |        False        |
| True  | False | False |        False         |        False        |
| False | True  | True  |        False         |        False        |
| False | True  | False |         True         |        True         |
| False | False | True  |         True         |        True         |
| False | False | False |         True         |        True         |

<p>
Anyone who got this first question wrong on the test is probably still
struggling with the following relationship:
</p><blockquote>
<code>P =&gt; Q</code> <i>is logically equivalent to</i> <code>~P or Q</code>
</blockquote><p>
You need to commit this to the very essence of your being, so that you just
<i>know it</i>!</p>
</li><li>
<p>The main tools you have when writting a proof are:</p>
<ul>
<li>definitions</li>
<li>propositions</li>
<li><i>specific</i> givens</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll talk about how each of these are used in the proof on the test.
We'll also highlight alternative approaches to a given proof, with
Gabriel C.'s proof for problem 2 using a set theory instead of alegraic
argument as an example, which José has kindly reproduced for us
<a href="https://codeberg.org/GraceHopperCenter/csc208/src/branch/main/ch1_logic/sect1.6.md">

<h3>Introducing Graphs</h3>
<div>
<p>
Let's start with a discussion of the three <i>Reading Questions</i> at the end
of the section.
</p>

<h4>Is there more than one graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges?</h4>
<p>
When working with graphs, we need to understand what it means to
<q>be a graph</q>. The definition of <b>graph</b> is:
</p><blockquote>
An ordered pair G = (V, E) consisting of a nonempty set V (called the vertices) and a set E (called the edges) of two-element subsets of V.
</blockquote><p>
Graphs are <b>equal</b> when V and E are equal, but when we talk about
<q>more than one graph</q> we are interested in the concept of
<b>isomorphism</b>:
</p><blockquote>
An isomorphism between two graphs G1 and G2 is a bijection f: V1 -&gt; V2
between the vertices of the graphs such that {a, b} is an edge in G1 if and
only if {f(a), f(b)}  is an edge in G2.
</blockquote><p>
I want to draw your attention to the fact that isomorphism is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation">equivalence
relation</a>, which means it is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation">reflexive</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation">symetric</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation">transitive</a>.
When we ask if two graphs are the same, we are usually asking if they are
isometric.
</p><p>
In this first reading question, we are really asking is: <q>Is there more than
one <b>isomorphism class</b> with 5 vertices and 6 edges?</q>
</p><p>
Take a look at this:
</p><p class="illustration">
<img src="images/non-isomorphic_graphs.png" alt="non-isomorphic graphs">
</p><p>
Well, what do you think?
</p>

<h4>A graph with 10 vertices of degree 4 has how many edges?</h4>
<p>
The answer to this question is a straight up application of the
<i>Handshake Lemma</i>. So what is it?
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete all <i>Practice Problems</i> and as many <i>Additional Problems</i>
from <i>Section 2.1: Problems and Definitions</i> as time enables. Come to
class on Tuesday prepared with questions on any problems that give you pause.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Wednesday, March 5th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will have a test today on <i>Chapter 1: Logic and Proofs</i>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read section <i>2.1: Graph Theory: Problems and Definitions</i>. Spend some
time thinking about the famous
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">Seven
Bridges of Königsberg</a> problem presented at the beginning of the chapter.
</p>

<h2>Monday, March 3rd</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin class by discussing any questions you have from the exercises
assigned last Thursday. You'll have the rest of class and homework time
to continue working exercises from the lists below.
</p><p>
Prepare a single sheet of 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper, front and back, with notes
you can use on Wednesday's test. I recommend you include the definitions
and propositions presented in the chapter. 
</p>
</div>

<h3>Blu's List</h3>
<div>
<p>
Here is the promised <i>Blu's list</i> for the test on Wednesday:
</p>
<h4>Section 1.5: Proofs about Discrete Structues</h4> 
<ul>
<li><b>Practice Problems</b>: 1 through 5</li>
<li><b>Additional Exercises</b>: 1 through 12</li>
</ul>
<h4>Section 1.6: Chapter Summary</h4> 
<ul>
<li><b>Chapter Review</b>: 1 through 7, 8a, 9 and 10</li>
</ul><p>
Be sure you are comfortable generating truth tables, and can do the kinds of
proofs presented in the examples and exercises, which means being able to use
the <i>definitions</i> and <i>propositions</i> effectively. Having these handy
on your 8 1/2 by 11 inch resource sheet will be most useful to you.
