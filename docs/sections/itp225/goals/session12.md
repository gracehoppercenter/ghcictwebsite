## What We'll Do In Class


### CRUD application
We will continue working in our pairs today on our custom CRUD applications.
Remember, we're working on our `pair programming` skills just as much as our
Django skills. We'll check in near the end of class to see how this is going and how much
more time we'll need.

## Homework

### Watch Dr Chuck's Videos about Many to Many models
[Lesson 27](https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_many)

For now, only the first two videos: 'Many to Many Overview' and 'A Simple Many-To-Many Example in Django'

As always, come prepared next class for a (possible) reading quiz. And start
thinking about potential many-to-many models that you could include in your project.
