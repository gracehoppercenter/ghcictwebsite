## What We'll Do In Class

### Chris is out

I'm on a field trip today, so you'll have a substitute named Jeff. I think you'll
recognize him =).

### Add Many-To-Many models to our CRUD application
We will continue working in our pairs today on our custom CRUD applications. Your 
goal today is to add at least one many-to-many relationship to your app.

Remember that we're trying to use the standard ORM mappings when we're traversing
relationships in our models. You'll find that this is just as easy with
many-to-many relationships was it was with one-to-many relationships. This is super nice!
See the examples 
[in Django's official documentation here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/models/relations/)

Remember, we're working on our `pair programming` skills just as much as our
Django skills. 

## Homework

### Read about Logins
Our next goal will be to add a login system to our website. As with everything
else, Django makes this easy =)

Watch [Dr. Chuck's videos about users and authentication](https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_users).

Take notes, and come prepared for a possible reading quiz next class.
