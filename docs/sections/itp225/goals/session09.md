## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:
- **Understand** the importance of one-to-many relationships in database design
- **Understand** how the Django ORM represents one-to-many relationships
- **Be able to** create a Django app that includes one-to-many relationships

## What We'll Do In Class

### One to many relationships
We'll continue working on our one-to-many activity that we started with last class.

I'll quickly go over [the code that I wrote to get this to work](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/django_projects/commit/cfd2d4b007b45c1d93d0bde23d993aef537777d1)

And then we'll work together to get everyone's code to work.

## Homework

### Continue Working on our Django Many-to-one code
As always, shoot us an email if you get stuck!

### Watch Forms Videos
Last class, we asked you to watch Dr. Chuck's first two videos about forms: [https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_forms_html](https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_forms_html)

- Building HTML Forms
- Forms and CSRF

This class, you should watch the rest of the videos on that page. We'll work 
on forms on Friday.

As always, take notes in your repo and be prepared for a possible reading quiz next class!
