## What We'll Do In Class


### Quiz

We will have a brief quiz at the beginning of class. You can use one 8 1/2 by
11 inch sheet of paper with notes.

### CRUD application
We will be working on CRUD application. You and your teammate should work together to decide what app to make, but it should include at least two models with a foreign key relationship.

Here are the pairs:

- Lary and Erij
- Chris G. and Sean G.
- Lucy and Giselle
- Delanie and Sean F.
- Chris J. and Jeff
Antoan has kindly offered to serve as "Mr. Fixit" for any of us who run into
problems.

To make these CRUD applications work, you'll want to incorporate Django's 'Generic Edit Views', which Dr. Chuck introduces in [Lesson 18](https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_autos) (you'll watch this for homework) You might also want to check out Django's own documentation about them here: [Generic Editing Views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/class-based-views/generic-editing/)
