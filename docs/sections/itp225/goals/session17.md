## What We'll Do In Class


### Substitute

Chris will be out today, so Jeff will be  your substitute today. Jeff will quickly review 
the requirements listed on this page to make sure everyone is on the same page.

### Final Project Requirements

We've built this project up in stages over the past several classes, so here's a summary of everything
i'm expecting your project to have:

- At least two models (not counting Django's built-in user model)
    - At least one foreign key (anything owned by a user count)
    - At least one many-to-many relationship
    - CRUD works for all data models
- Some custom CSS (so that your project doesn't just look like "Chris and Jeff's Django Projects")
- A way for users to login and logout
- Reasonable permissioning controls, using `LoginRequiredMixin` and `User*Views`


### Project Timeline
Here's the timeline that I'm planning for us to wrap up the project:

- Today: Start working on Owned Rows
- Friday: Wrap up the project
- Tuesday: Project due, present in class

I will be out on Friday, so I'll ask Jeff to have a conversation with you all in class about how reasonable 
this timeline is. If we need to push the due date back to Thursday, that's fine!
