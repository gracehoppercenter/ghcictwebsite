## What We'll Do In Class

### Reading Quiz

We'll start with the reading quiz about Django's login system. As always,
you're welcome to use any notes that you brought with you.

### Project Check-in
We've been working on pair programming on our projects for a few classes now,
so this is a good time for us to check in on how it's going. I'll ask each
group to do a quick share about what you've been working on. Our goal is that you'll
be able to demonstrate CRUD or a model or two, and talk us through your models
(which at this point should include at least one foreign key and one many-to-many
relationship)

### Add Login to your project

Continue working with your partner to add a login system to your project.

### A look ahead

Our final topic for this project is tonight's reading, `owned rows`. Once we 
incorporate that concept into our project, we'll officially submit and grade
this project.

## Homework

### Read about Owned Rows
As with everything
else, the concepts here can be a little bit tricky, and we care
that you understand them, but Django makes this easy =)

Watch [Dr. Chuck's videos about Owned Rows](https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_owned).

Take notes, and come prepared for a possible reading quiz next class.
