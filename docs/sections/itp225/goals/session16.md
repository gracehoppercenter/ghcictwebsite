## What We'll Do In Class


### Owned Rows

Dr. Chuck deviated from official Django to create his own class-based views 
that restrict to items that the logged-in user owns.

This is a great example to practice 
with object-oriented programming, so we'll spend a few minutes at the beginning
of class making sure that we all understand how it works.

We'll also discuss that these classes won't always be necessary or helpful. I'll share the
drawing that I've used in my own project to help keep track of which views 
require 'User' restrictions and which don't.

[You can see my drawing here](images/pnp_view_planning.jpg), and the views with the purple
dots are the ones where I'm currently planning to use Dr. Chuck's 'User' views.

I won't require that you make a planning diagram like this, but I'll strongly recommend it =).

### Final Project Requirements And Timeline

I'll summarize my final expectations for this project and the completion timeline.
