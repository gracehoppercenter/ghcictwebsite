## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:
- **Understand** the importance of one-to-many relationships in database design
- **Understand** how the Django ORM represents one-to-many relationships
- **Be able to** create a Django app that includes one-to-many relationships

## What We'll Do In Class

### ToDo App Sharing
We'll quickly check in on how the to-do project worked last class. As before, we'll use our random name chooser to select two people who will share their progress with us all

### One to many relationships
We'll quickly review one-to-many relationships, and talk about how to implement them in Django.

I like DJango's official documentation here: [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/db/examples/many_to_one/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/db/examples/many_to_one/)

### Our reservation project
As a group, we'll revisit the requirements for our reservation system projects. We'll select two models that we think are most-critical, and we'll implement them as Django models.

We'll also quickly peek at the data models that our databases class created, here: [https://github.com/Miguel-Vargas-07/ite140/blob/main/create_tables_culinary.sql](https://github.com/Miguel-Vargas-07/ite140/blob/main/create_tables_culinary.sql)

### Build it!
Once we've defined our models, we'll follow the same steps we did last time to setup this app. As before, our goals will be to create ListViews and DetailViews, and we'll continue using the admin interface to create date for now.

#### Groups
Here are the groups that we broke into:
- Culinary: Delanie, Sean F, Sean G, Lucy, Erij
    - [Their model diagram is here](../images/cul_diagram.jpeg) 
- Cosmetology: Antoan, Chris, Giselle, Lary
    - [Their model diagram is here](../images/cos_diagram.jpeg)

## Homework

### Continue Working on our Django Reservation System
As before, don't feel pressured to complete everything - just get as far as you can!

### Watch Forms Videos
We want to move away from using the admin interface to add data. Watch Dr. Chuck's first two videos about forms: [https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_forms_html](https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_forms_html)

- Building HTML Forms
- Forms and CSRF

As always, take notes in your repo and be prepared for a possible reading quiz next class!
