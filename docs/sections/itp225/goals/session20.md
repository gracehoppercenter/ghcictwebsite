## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:


## What We'll Do In Class

### Chat about grades

I've updated your grades in StudentVue, and the end of the quarter is upon us. We'll have a quick chat to make sure we're all on the same page about grading.


### PR Activity Followup

I'll quickly demonstrate how merging/closing a Pull Request works


### Organizing Ourselves

We'll have a quick chat about keeping our projects organized. 

I have a few proposals, which we'll discuss as a group. These are just proposals, and I'm open to discussion

- We'll use the Wiki, Issue, and PR features of github to track our development
    - Review my proposed wiki organization conventions
- Stand-up meetings, every class, as a whole class, motivated by the Github Project dashboard
    - During the meeting, we'll review status of open issues, plan new issues, and hear any feedback from
        our customers
    - Would we prefer to split this by project?


### Our first stand-up!

Today's stand-up objectives:
- Form teams. Here's my proposal:
    - Culinary: Delanie, Sean F, Sean G, Lucy
    - Cosmetology: Antoan, Chris, Giselle
    - (Erij and Lary will join these groups in a few classes)
- Review the notes that I've added to the wikis for both groups
- Assign issues
