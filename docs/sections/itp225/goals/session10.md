## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* use a web form to get data from a user. 
* extract data from a post and store it in the database.
* create a full web application (front to back) in Django.


## What We'll Do In Class

We'll start class by taking a look at where we are in the [Django for Everybody
Lessons](https://www.dj4e.com/lessons) and discuss our strategy for learning
the next several key ideas we'll need for web application development:

* Forms
* Cookies and Sessions
* Users and Authentication
* Full CRUD Applications

We are going to rearrange the order of presentation of these topics from the
way Dr. Chuck does it, and in class we'll discuss why.

We will then talk about
[programming programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)
and watch a [Code.org video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) on
it.

Finally, we'll pair up and have each pair build their own CRUD application to
share with the class next week.


## Homework

* Watch *The POST Refresh Pattern* and *Implementing POST Redirect in Django*
  from the
  [Forms in HTTP and HTML](https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_forms_html)
  lesson.

* Review all the previous videos from this lesson, and prepare a one page,
  8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper with notes (you can use both sides) on the key
  concepts from this lesson.

* Come prepared for a quiz on *Forms in HTTP and HTML* when you arrive in class
  next Tuesday.
