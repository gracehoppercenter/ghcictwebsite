## What We'll Do In Class

### Present Django Projects

Each group will share their Django projects today, and I'll add this as a grade in our grade book. You've worked hard on this project for **8** class periods, so I'm excited to see what you've come up with!

### Git Practice

This might be the first project many of you have worked on that involved sharing a repo with a lot of people. We'll discuss some norms and rules for sharing a git repo.

### Inital Django Configuration

If we have time, one person in each project should get the initial Django configuration started.

I've already created an issue for this work in both repos.
