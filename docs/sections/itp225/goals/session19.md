## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:


## What We'll Do In Class

### Present Django Projects

Each group will share their Django projects today, and I'll add this as a grade in our grade book. You've worked hard on this project for **8** class periods, so I'm excited to see what you've come up with!


### Back to the Reservation Project
We'll have a short chat about our plans to return to the reservation project

### Git Practice

This might be the first project many of you have worked on that involved sharing a repo with a lot of people. We'll discuss some norms and rules for sharing a git repo. To practice, we'll work through an activity I recently wrote for my web class, here <https://ict.gctaa.net/sections/itd210/goals/session.html?num=05>.
