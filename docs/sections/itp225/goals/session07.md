We spent most of all of this class working through issues with the todo list
practice assignment. I think at the end of the class we all felt a lot better
about the assignment!

## Homework

Your assignment is to get the todo list assignment across the line.

You aren't alone in this assignment - send an email to Chris and Jeff (at our VCCS email addresses) explaining your issue and giving us a link to your repo. We'll 
take a look and do our best to help! If you do, be sure to keep an eye on your email
for our response!

At the beginning of next class, we'll expect that everyone either:
- has the todo project working
- has an ongoing, active email thread with Chris and Jeff
